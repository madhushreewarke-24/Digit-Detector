# Object-Detection-Using-Tensorflow
In this project, I did Object Detection with TensorFlow, and the idea was to educate a computer in identifying and detecting objects in images.
Here I have performed detection of  single digit number that is identify the number and position in the image. This topic object detection is now an integral part of our everyday lives—from security cameras and autonomous vehicles to healthcare and intelligent devices.
I developed our model with TensorFlow, trained it with data sets, and tuned it so that it could recognize multiple objects simultaneously with good precision. It wasn't always a smooth process, though—there were issues such as working with large data sets and ensuring that the system was both fast and accurate. But issues like that served to show us how machine learning works in reality. This project was about seeing just how powerful and helpful AI can actually be.
